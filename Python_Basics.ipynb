What is Python, and why is it popular\u001a\n","-> Python is a programming language used to build softwares like web applications and AI ML. It is so popular as it has multiple uses and then also it is easy to learn and code.\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python\u001a\n","-> An interpreter in python is used to translate high level language into machine understandable code and it transaltes one line after other.\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\u001a\n","-> Pre-defined keywords refer to those words that can't be used as variable, class or function names as they already have some functionalities encoded for them.\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names\u001a\n","-> No the keywords that are pre-defined can't be used as variable names.\n","5. What is mutability in Python\u001a\n","-> Mutability refers to the changes that can be made in a data structure such as list.\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\u001a\n","-> It is because different data structure has different functionalities and properties.\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\u001a\n","-> The '==' operator is used to compare two values whereas the 'is' operator is used to compare the memory block of the value that whether both the data is refering to the same memory block.\n","8. What are logical operators in Python\u001a\n","-> Logical operators in python such as AND, OR, NOT are used in combinational statement where there are two or more than two conditions to put.\n","9.  What is type casting in Python\u001a\n","-> Type casting in python refers to converting a variable from one type to another, for example from string to integer.\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\u001a\n","-> Implicit type casting refers to the automatic type casting that is done by the python itself where as explicit type casting is done manually by the coder.\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\u001a\n","-> The conditional statements in python are used to put conditions so that they code may work differently in different inputs which makes the code more flexible.\n","12. How does the elif statement work\u001a\n","-> The elif statment works when we want to put more than two conditions, it does make code more flexible and more efficient.\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops\u001a\n","-> While loops are used to do perform some task on repitition mode until some conditions are met whereas the for loop is mainly used to iterator over the elements of a data structure such as list and string, and can also work like while loop.\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n","-> While loop is suitable when we don't want to put the iteration or a range to let the loop run like if we want the user to give the input from 1 to 10 and not more than that then we can without any doubts use the while loop\n","for example,\n","user_input= int(input(\"A number b/w 1 to 10\"))\n","while user_input>10 and user_input<1:\n","  user_input=int(input())\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Exwp7aVbV8xb"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qQqtE68eF8uz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732826145449,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1329,"user":{"displayName":"Charlie Michael","userId":"06695180309912484272"}},"outputId":"cbfeb4ef-89f3-4aa2-d369-fbc314dcbeb7"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}],"source":["#1.
